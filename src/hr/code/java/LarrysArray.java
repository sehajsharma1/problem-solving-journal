    If they are Even then it is possible to get sorted array after rotating triples.
    since after rotating or transposing the array the total number of inversions will either increase by 2 or decrease by 2 so if total number of inversions are even then eventually after rotating after some point you'll get inversions 0 which implies that array is sorted but in case you have total inversions odd you can never have 0 inversions after rotating or transposing*/
