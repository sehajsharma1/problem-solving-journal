### 📌 Prefix Marking Technique

* Mark each interval with `+1` at the start and `-1` at `(end + 1)` in an auxiliary array.
* Compute a prefix sum over the array — any region where the sum `> 0` represents covered (merged) interval space.
* A transition `0 → >0` indicates the start of a merged interval, and `>0 → 0` marks its end.
* Best used when the numeric range is known and reasonably small, making it memory-efficient.

### 📌 **Formula Used (Exponentiation by Squaring)**

- If `n < 0`: `x^n = 1 / x^{-n}`.
- If `n` is even: `x^n = (x^{n/2})^2`.
- If `n` is odd: `x^n = x * x^{n-1}`.

XOR cancels duplicates because a ^ a = 0, so all paired numbers become zero and only the unique number remains.

Two intervals [a₁, a₂] and [b₁, b₂] overlap iff a₁ ≤ b₂ and a₂ ≥ b₁.

Backtracking is an algorithmic problem-solving technique where a solution is built step by step by trying all possible choices, and whenever a choice leads to an invalid state or a completed solution, the algorithm reverses (backtracks) that choice to explore other options. For example, while generating all letter combinations for a phone number like "23", the algorithm picks 'a' for 2, then tries 'd', 'e', 'f' for 3 to form "ad", "ae", "af", and after each combination, it removes the last letter and tries the next one, ensuring all valid combinations are explored efficiently.

backtrack(state):
if state is a valid solution:
record answer
return

    for each possible choice:
        make the choice
        backtrack(new state)
        undo the choice

Try → Recurse → Backtrack

(r / 3) * 3 + (c / 3) gives the index (0–8) of the 3×3 Sudoku box a cell belongs to, where rows choose the box row and columns choose the box column.

## 8 Directions in a 2D Grid

Each cell in a 2D array has 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
The direction arrays store relative row and column offsets: `-1` (up/left), `0` (same), `+1` (down/right).
Combining these offsets gives all adjacent cells except the center `(0,0)`.
`newRow = row + rowDir[i]` and `newCol = col + colDir[i]` move to each neighbor.
This pattern is widely used in DFS/BFS grid problems.

Kadane's Algorithm:
Keep adding numbers while the sum is positive.
If it becomes negative, restart — and remember the best sum found.
